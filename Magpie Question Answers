1.	What happens when more than one keyword appears in a string? Consider the string “My mother has a dog but no cat.” Explain how to prioritize responses in the reply method.
When more than one keyword appears in a string, the program returns the indexed response for the first keyword, and doesn’t return anything else for the second word.
2.	What happens when a keyword is included in another word? Consider statements like “I know all the state capitals” and “I like vegetables smothered in cheese.” Explain the problem with the responses to these statements. 
When a keyword is included in another word, the console returns the indexed statement relating to that keyword. To remedy to this problem, the programmer should include blank spaces at the end of the keyword.
